[Esolang Interpreters #4 - Boolfuck Interpreter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5861487fdb20cff3ab000030)

*For the rest of this Kata, I recommend considering "fuck" to be non-profane.*

\# About this Kata Series:

"Esolang Interpreters" is a Kata Series that originally began as three separate, independent esolang interpreter Kata authored by [@donaldsebleung](http://codewars.com/users/donaldsebleung) which all shared a similar format and were all somewhat inter-related. Under the influence of [a fellow Codewarrior](https://www.codewars.com/users/nickkwest), these three high-level inter-related Kata gradually evolved into what is known today as the "Esolang Interpreters" series.

This series is a high-level Kata Series designed to challenge the minds of bright and daring programmers by implementing interpreters for various [esoteric programming languages/Esolangs](http://esolangs.org/), mainly [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) derivatives but not limited to them, given a certain specification for a certain Esolang. Perhaps the only exception to this rule is the very first Kata in this Series which is intended as an introduction/taster to the world of esoteric programming languages and writing interpreters for them.

\# The Language:

Boolfuck is an [esoteric programming language (Esolang)](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) based on the famous [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) (also an Esolang) which was invented in 2004 or 2005 according to [the official website](http://samuelhughes.com/boof/index.html). It is very similar to Brainfuck except for a few key differences:

- Boolfuck works with bits as opposed to bytes
- The tape for Brainfuck contains exactly 30,000 cells with the pointer starting from the very left; Boolfuck contains an infinitely long tape with the pointer starting at the "middle" (since the tape can be extended indefinitely either direction)
- Each cell in Boolfuck can only contain the values `0` or `1` (i.e. bits not bytes) as opposed to Brainfuck which has cells containing values ranging from `0` to `255` inclusive.
- The output command in Boolfuck is `;` NOT `.`
- The `-` command does **not** exist in Boolfuck since either `+` or `-` would flip a bit anyway

Anyway, here is a list of commands and their descriptions:

- `+` - Flips the value of the bit under the pointer
- `,` - Reads a bit from the input stream, storing it under the pointer. The end-user types information using characters, though. Bytes are read in little-endian orderâ€”the first bit read from the character `a`, for instance, is 1, followed by 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, and finally 0. If the end-of-file has been reached, outputs a zero to the bit under the pointer.
- `;` - Outputs the bit under the pointer to the output stream. The bits get output in little-endian order, the same order in which they would be input. If the total number of bits output is not a multiple of eight at the end of the program, the last character of output gets padded with zeros on the more significant end.
- `<` - Moves the pointer left by 1 bit
- `>` - Moves the pointer right by 1 bit
- `[` - If the value under the pointer is `0` then skip to the corresponding `]`
- `]` - Jumps back to the matching `[` character

If you haven't written an interpreter for Brainfuck yet I recommend you to complete [this Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/my-smallest-code-interpreter-aka-brainf-star-star-k) first.

\# The Task:

Write a Boolfuck interpreter which accepts up to two arguments. The first (required) argument is the Boolfuck code in the form of a string. The second (optional) argument is the input passed in by the **end-user** (i.e. as actual characters not bits) which should default to `""` if not provided. Your interpreter should return the output as actual characters (not bits!) as a string.

```rust
fn boolfuck(code: &str, input: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8>
```

Preloaded for you is a function `brainfuckToBoolfuck()`/`brainfuck_to_boolfuck()`/`BrainfuckToBoolfuck()` which accepts 1 required argument (the Brainfuck code) and returns its Boolfuck equivalent should you find it useful.

Please note that your interpreter should simply ignore any non-command characters.  **This will be tested in the test cases.**

If in doubt, feel free to refer to the official website (link at top).

Good luck :D
