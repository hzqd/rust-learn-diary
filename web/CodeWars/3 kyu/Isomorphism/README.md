[Isomorphism](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5922543bf9c15705d0000020)

We will walk through what is isomorphism, and define some common isomorphism. It is closely related to bijection (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection>).

This kata possibly unlocks [Algebraic Isomorphism](https://www.codewars.com/kata/algebraic-isomorphism), [Peano And Church](https://www.codewars.com/kata/peano-and-church/).

Note: this kata is significantly easier in Haskell than in anyother language. We wont reply at complain for other languages unless you had completed it in Haskell.
P.S. The tests are CORRECT. There're some easy-to-make mistakes (see the discussion area). Please figure out how to solve this yourself.

Detailed instruction is written in the comments of the initial solution.

If you have trouble, you can look at [Bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) for intuition.
