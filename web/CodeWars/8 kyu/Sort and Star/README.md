## Detail
[Sort and Star](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sort-and-star/train/rust)
You will be given an vector of string(s). You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive!!) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have `"***"` between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.

## Thinking

Find the `min()` then `format!()` it.
