![Aurevoir Xavier's codewars badges](https://www.codewars.com/users/AurevoirXavier/badges/small)

All kata done with **Rust**.

I wrote my **thinking** in the `README.md` which under the relevant kata's folder. Hope that can help you or inspire you. 

Each folder is a **cargo** project. 

You can simply test your data by adding function(s) in `lib.rs`, don't forget to add `#[test]` over them.

Warning: Most of the kata was **related** to some mathematical theories. I won't **elaborate** or **prove** those theories.
